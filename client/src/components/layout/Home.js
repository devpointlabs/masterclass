					<p>'What an amazing journey and experience, I learned so much during my time at DevPoint Labs! I started with some basic knowledge and with the the assistance of the intense course curriculum and the incredible staff, instructor and TAâ€™s, I was able to build an amazing foundation and understanding of programming. I am very excited for the new and life changing opportunities ahead! I would recommend DevPoint Labs to anyone who is considering attending a coding bootcamp.'</p>

I had no previous experience with coding before this bootcamp and I am impressed with how much I learned in just a short amount of time. Dave was an amazing instructor and the TA's were awesome too. Even after my class has ended Dave continues to help with questions and he genuinely cares about your success. '</p>
